# Udacity-RSE-Project1

This project was to create a world in a gazebo using the building editor and model editor.
I also created a simple world plugin that prints a message when the world is loaded up.
The world I created will serve as a base for upcoming projects where a robot will navigate through the environments.

The models in the world are picked from gazebo's online directory with the exception of the two dogs which where created with the model editor.
